# EduCamps

Website: http://educamps.us 
(Hosted on AWS version using MySQL server on and EC2 instance)

Description & my contribution:
EduCamps is a website for users to sign up their children for different camps nationwide. Users can shop items, post picture memories, reviews and even send emails to contact EduCamps for more information. I built the entire back-end and part of the front-end of the site. Using PHP, MySQL, Javascrcipt, JQuery, AJAX and HTML/CSS. Server-side processing was done through PHP and MySQL. Specific APIs like Charts.js and Google's API was also used. I also launched an EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS), where I then installed the LAMP stack and hosted our website along with using a database on the server. 

*Note: This website is not meant for actual use; however, can be used for one who needs such functionalities!
